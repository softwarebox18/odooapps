            <p>The <b>Model-Based Delete Action Control</b> app provides a highly customizable way to control the visibility of the delete action menu button across Odoo models, ensuring enhanced security and streamlined management of sensitive records. This app empowers administrators to determine which users can see and use the delete action based on their group membership and the specific models they are working with. By enabling model-wise configurations, you can easily decide where to apply delete restrictions, all while maintaining flexibility across your entire Odoo environment.</p>
            <p>With a simple toggle control for each model, administrators can selectively hide or show the delete button based on business requirements. For example, if you want to prevent the accidental deletion of sale orders, you can activate the toggle for Sale Orders. This prevents users in the designated group from deleting any sale order records while allowing deletion in other areas of the system.</p>
            <p>This app is perfect for organizations looking to boost security, prevent data loss, and retain control over critical business records, especially in high-compliance environments. Whether you need to protect sales data, accounting entries, or operational workflows, the Model-Based Delete Action Control app provides an easy-to-manage solution.</p>
